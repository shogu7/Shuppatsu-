# Shuppatsu - Manga Release Bot

Shuppatsu is a Discord bot designed to scrape and display manga releases from MangaCollect. It checks for manga releases scheduled for the next day or the current day and posts the information in a specified Discord channel.

**Note:** This project is still in development and is not fully functional yet. Some features may not work as expected, and improvements are ongoing.

## Features

- Scrapes manga release information from [MangaCollect](https://www.mangacollec.com/planning).
- Filters the releases based on the date.
- Sends the release information (title, release date, and cover image) as a Discord embed.
- Allows users to trigger the bot manually with the `!mangas` command.
